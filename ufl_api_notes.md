# UFL API notes

- Appears to use Statbroadcast as the stats API
- Webpages may have embedded JSON response data (?)

## API hooks:

Schedule: https://stats.statbroadcast.com/interface/scoreboard/page/?&gid=ufl
Standings: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.statbroadcast.com/hosted/ufl/{season}standings.json
